 Game Theory with Noisy Channels

The goal with this project is to study how games of strategy change as noise is introduced into the communications. Information asymmetry plays an important role in strategy and measurement. Sophisticated interaction with the world requires some carefully tuned sense of the quality of information delivered and received.

For starters, I will examine Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Firstly, simple strategies found from the Axelrod tournments will be employed. Eventually this work will build to include differential noise applied for "read" as well as "write" from the game.

## Read/Write in the Context of Games
We can view a player's interaction with a game with making moves is writing and reading the outcome as reading. The victory condition is still determined by what occurs in the actual game, but a player's strategy may be informed by incorrect information as to the outcome of the game.

## Markovian Noise

I'll enter more stuff here later. I don't think anyone has done anything like this before so I'll wait to write something audacious here until I examine the literature further.


## Strategy Degredation

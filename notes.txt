	Goal
		Recreate evolution of competition paper but under the basic noise model 

	we need to build succesive round robin tourny that 
		"the strategies in the second round 
			were submitted to a hypothetical next
			round in proportion to its success in the
			previous round"	

// interesting 
	under a 10% noise , titforavgtat stays alive for much longer than normal TfT , thought all D still dominates
